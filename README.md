# Zero-point-dichotoming-of-functions
#To help Chinese high school students solve the problem of function zero-point dichotomy, please use Python version 2.7 or above
#Instructions for use：
In the function "f(x)", modify the parsing you need, then find the approximate position of the zero point and enter the precision you need, then press enter ...
#Error analysis：
If the value you enter does not meet "f(a)*f(b)<0" then it will not run, and if the initial interval you enter is too outrageous, it will produce a value that does not match the answer, it doesn't matter, it's because of the problem of the exact value, which is actually correct, please feel free to use
